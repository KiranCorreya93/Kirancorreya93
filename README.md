## 🚀 About Me

I am a results-driven data professional with a background in **problem solving, business operations, and analytics**.  
My passion for data began during my tenure at **Amazon**, where I optimized workflow management processes using **SQL** and **Python-based clustering tools**, driving measurable business impact.

Since then, I have deepened my technical skills through an **MSc in Data Analytics** and applied them to real-world projects with comprehensive analysis using python and building an interactive **Power BI dashboard**
