## 🚀 About Me

I am a results-driven data professional with a background in **problem solving, business operations, and analytics**.  
My passion for data began during my tenure at **Amazon**, where I optimized workflow management processes using **SQL** and **Python-based clustering tools**, driving measurable business impact.

Since then, I have deepened my technical skills through an **MSc in Data Analytics** and applied them to real-world projects, including a comprehensive analysis of the **UK data job market (2025)** — building an interactive **Power BI dashboard** from over 6,000 job listings.

I believe in the power of data to drive better business decisions, and I am continuously learning new techniques to stay ahead in this rapidly evolving field.
