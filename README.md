## 🚀 About Me

I am a results-driven **Data Analyst** with a strong foundation in **problem solving, business operations, and analytics**.  
My passion for data was ignited during my tenure at **Amazon**, where I optimized workflow management using **SQL** and **Python-based clustering tools**, delivering measurable business outcomes.

Building on this foundation, I pursued an **MSc in Data Analytics**, applying my skills to real-world problems such as an in-depth analysis of the **UK Data Job Market (2025)**, utilizing **Python** and creating an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.

I am driven by the belief that **data transforms decision-making** — and I constantly seek new tools, techniques, and methodologies to stay ahead in this evolving field.
